Use the Settings menu to customize what races are picked, how stats are generated, and to add/remove backgrounds.
Backgrounds can also be added directly to the backgrounds.cfg file.

Use the File menu to preview and/or export the character to a .pdf.

Stats can be freely adjusted, but are constrained to 8 to 15 in point buy mode.

Click the die icon to generate only that section. If a section does not have a die icon then it only
accepts manually entered information.

To add more portraits, place the image(s) you want into the appropriate folder under 'images/[racename]'.

To add more races, create a folder under the 'images/' directory and name it the race you want (e.g., images/Aarakocra). 
Then just drop images into that folder to have them available. Please keep in mind that the url link to
https://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/ will only work if the race exists on the site under the DND section
and it is spelled correctly.

To reduce size, each race folder only has 10 images. A larger repository of images can be found at
